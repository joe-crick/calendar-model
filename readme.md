THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.

Calendar Model is what it says it is: It models calendrical data. It generates sets of Date objects. Date objects decorate a JS Date instance with a few convenience methods, and an events property. The events property is an array that can contain an arbitrary collection of events. 

Calendar Model is very small - 13kb.
